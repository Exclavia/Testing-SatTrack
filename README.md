# Satellite tracker - Testing repository.

Simple satellite tracker with a GUI that shows the next pass for a selected satellite over a given longitude and latitude based on minimum elevation.


This is the testing repo for my [Satellite Tracker](https://github.com/Exclavia/Satellite-Tracker) program. Commits may be unstable, or may just not work at all. I use this repository to maintain the building process of the main program, while letting only major updates, generally stable code, and fixes to be commited to the main repo.

## Submitting feedback/code
If you happened to stumble upon this repo and you're interested, feel free to fork it. While generally most features and ideas I personally come up with as this was made with personal use in mind, I don't mind assistance or feedback.
